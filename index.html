            There are few aspects of New Yorkers’ lives that have not been touched
            by COVID-19. As our city, state, and country continue to grapple with
            how to help families recover from this crisis, we must not overlook the
            impact of COVID-19 on children’s behavioral health. Without adequate
            support for children struggling with mental health challenges and
            substance use disorders, too many children will face the long-term
            impacts of unmet behavioral health needs.

        <p>
            Even prior to COVID-19, New York had a children’s behavioral
            healthcrisis.

            Access to care challenges have been in part driven by inadequate
            provider capacity. For example, in New York, there are only
            <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/144/6/e20191576/tab-article-info" target="_blank"> two child psychiatrists for every 10,000 children </a>. Families face barriers accessing care regardless of whether they need outpatient care, intensive inpatient services, or community support
            services. These challenges are even harder for families in rural areas
            or those in need of bilingual services.

            With the arrival of COVID-19, the need for behavioral health services
            has skyrocketed. The National Alliance on Mental Illness of NYC has reported a

            found that 62% of New York residents reported feeling anxiety for at
            least several days, while 55% experienced depression. New York’s youth are seeing a spike in reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression that are consistently higher than other age groups. From June to July, almost half of all youth aged 18 to 24 living in the NY Metro area reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.

            Importantly, the effects of this pandemic can be even more pronounced
            for children and adolescents. Extensive research on adverse childhood
            experiences tells us that the kinds of trauma caused by COVID-19 –
            including economic and housing insecurity, heightened risk of child
            welfare involvement, disruptions in mental health care, and loss of
            loved ones – have long-lasting repercussions across the health and
            wellbeing of children as they become adults. Though hospitals saw a
            temporary decline in psychiatric patients during the height of COVID,
            doctors are seeing a
            <a href="http://www.centernyc.org/news-center/2020/6/9/kids-and-covid-19-a-mental-health-crisis-looms"
                target="_blank">growing number of young people </a>come to hospitals with dangerous psychiatric
            emergencies, and fear that
            conditions will only worsen without an adequate response.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, with the transition to distance learning, many children
            have lost a source of stability and routine, and may experience feelings
            of social
            <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2764730" target="_blank">isolation and
                anxiety</a>. Many LGBTQ students may face heightened challenges if they live in
            unsupportive families and have lost their in-person connection to a more
            affirming school community. Additionally, the shuttering of schools has
            impaired the ability to identify and connect or maintain continuity of
            student’s access to clinical services. The importance of schools as a
            setting through which to receive clinical services is clear; a national
            study from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that
            more than 13% of adolescents received some form of mental health
            services in a school setting in the
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK362074/" target="_blank">previous 12 months</a>.
            Additionally, 35% of adolescents who receive any mental health
            services

            Like all other aspects of this pandemic, the mental toll of COVID-19 has
            fallen disproportionately on those already most marginalized. The health
            and economic impacts of COVID-19 have been felt most strongly in
            working-class immigrant neighborhoods, and among Black and brown
            communities that have faced

            Compounding the impact of COVID-19 are the harms of institutional
            anti-Blackness and police violence that children are grappling with in
            the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the police’s violent
            reaction to protests. Even prior to this crisis,

        <p>
            Americans stand at a precipice, with many of the federal COVID-19 relief
            benefits – such as unemployment insurance, cash payments, and federal
            eviction protections – having expired at the end of July. Yet Congress
            remains gridlocked, with Senate Republicans resisting the passage of a
            comprehensive COVID relief package that mirrors the HEROES Act proposed
            by the House. Without additional financial support, even more families
            and their children will suffer the psychological and emotional harms of
            economic distress, on top of anxieties related to isolation, loss of
            loved ones, and widespread uncertainty.

            The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)

            to help local providers better coordinate services for children with

        <p>
            As important as this funding has been, it only begins to scratch the
            surface of the need, and there has been insufficient attention to the
            specific behavioral health needs of children and adolescents.
        </p>

        <p>
            CCC joined national advocates in pushing for a $38.5 billion investment
            for providers of mental health and addiction treatment services,
            advocating that at least 25% of those funds be dedicated to children’s
            needs. This is part of a broader push, in recognition that if we do not
            also address the stressors facing families – child care, unemployment,
            primary healthcare access, food insecurity – mental health will suffer.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the state level, New York faced harsh budget realities even prior to
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the threat of cuts to children’s
            behavioral health services, advocates successfully pushed the state to
            preserve children’s behavioral health, and even restore a proposed 1.5%
            cut to Children and Family Treatment and Support Services. This has
            proved even more important than anticipated, as it meant New York
            entered this crisis without a severely damaged infrastructure for
            children’s behavioral health.
        </p>

        <p>
            New York has also taken important steps in implementing telehealth
            services, with state agencies moving quickly to ensure new flexibilities
            in access to telehealth services. An important legislative change now
            allows audio-only and video-only telehealth services in Medicaid and
            CHIP, which has helped expand opportunities to connect with patients.

        <div class="graph-wrapper pull-quote">
            <p>
                The threat of additional cuts places the state’s behavioral health

        <p>
            At the same time, New York’s dire economic and budget reality, threatens
            the stability of the children’s behavioral health system, among other
            systems. The state is facing $8 billion in revenue shortfalls, with
            great uncertainty regarding how much the federal government will invest
            in state relief. New York is currently withholding some of the funds
            intended to support local treatment providers, and
            <a href="https://www.timestelegram.com/news/20200719/how-covid-19-is-creating-mental-health-pandemic"
                target="_blank">
                is cutting funding for some behavioral health services by 20% </a>. The State also announced a proposed
            1.5% cut to children’s Home and
            Community Based Services (HCBS), which are intended to help meet the
            mental health needs of children in their homes and communities and
            prevent the need for institutional levels of care. The threat of
            additional cuts places the state’s behavioral health infrastructure and
            ability to serve children at risk.

            Priorities for Recovery
        </h2>

        <p>
            Budget decisions made at the federal level will directly impact the
            state’s budget, which will in turn impact New York City’s budget. As our
            state and federal governments consider how to address the behavioral
            health crisis among young people and prevent long-term harm, there are
            key areas that must be addressed.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Protect and Invest in Children’s Behavioral Health
        </h2>

        <p>
            At its core, we cannot ensure the wellbeing of children if our state and
            federal governments take a short-sighted approach to children’s mental
            health. Targeted investments are needed in children’s behavioral health
            services. Investments are also needed in the foundations of recovery and
            promotion of wellbeing – housing, nutrition, financial assistance,
            unemployment insurance – that support family and household stability and
            protect children from the stressors that can drive poor mental health.

                Congress must pass comprehensive stimulus legislation to help
                struggling families </a>. Without this assistance, families in New York and across the country
            face long term hardship and resulting trauma.

        <div class="graph-wrapper pull-quote">

                Only by investing in children now can we avoid the long-term

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            At the state level, New York must continue to protect and invest in the
            children’s behavioral health infrastructure. Only by investing in
            children now can we avoid the long-term repercussions of trauma and
            unmet mental health needs. Those families most impacted by the economic
            downturn, illness, and loss are those most in need of behavioral health
            supports for their children. We strongly support the State’s efforts to
            draw down additional federal funding. We also recognize that by
            protecting and strengthening state investments, we can reduce
            hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and prevent the emergence of
            more complex needs among children that are harder to address later in
            life. New York must resist any proposed cuts to children’s behavioral
            health care, including the proposed 1.5% rate cut to HCBS services.

            Make Telehealth Flexibilities Permanent, and Ensure Equitable Access to
            Telehealth Services

                ... New York must continue to protect and invest in the children’s
                behavioral health infrastructure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            New flexibilities to provide telehealth services have been a lifeline
            for many children and families, allowing them to stay connected to the
            critical health and behavioral health supports they need. However, thus
            far many of these flexibilities are temporary and tied to the
            declaration of a state of emergency. Particularly given the uncertainty
            of the future, it is critical that many of these regulatory
            flexibilities become permanent fixtures. Additionally, New York must
            reimburse telehealth visits at the same level as comparable in-person
            visits to maximize options for children and families.
        </p>

        <p>
            As important as telehealth is, we must also acknowledge its potential
            role in exacerbating inequities in telehealth access, and that
            telehealth is not in itself a silver bullet to long-standing capacity
            challenges.

                Too many families still lack access to reliable broadband or internet
                to access services </a>, and the digital divide disproportionately impacts low income
            communities and communities of color. For those that have experienced a
            racially discriminatory healthcare system, teleservices may not feel
            like a safe alternative to in-person care. Telehealth can also pose
            challenges for very young children, children with disabilities, families
            who lack privacy, and families who speak languages other than English.
        </p>

        <p>
            For these reasons and more, New York must work carefully to ensure
            equitable access to telehealth services. This means prioritizing the
            needs of children and families and respecting their choices regarding
            how they want services delivered. It also means addressing the digital
            divide and ensuring all families have access to the devices and internet
            connectivity they need. In developing a new statewide plan for
            telehealth, careful attention must be paid to those patients most likely
            to be left behind, and how to ensure they receive the care they need.

            Support the Behavioral Health Needs of Students
        </h2>

        <p>
            Though students engaged in remote learning throughout the spring, their
            need for school-based services has not faded. Great uncertainty remains
            over how children’s next school year will look, but schools will remain
            an important site – whether physical or virtual – for connecting
            children to emotional and behavioral supports.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many students may have new behavioral health needs that are not easy to
            identify. It is therefore essential that educators have the training
            they need on trauma-responsive care. Students suffer when schools lack
            the tools to respond to trauma and instead respond with punishment,
            emergency medical services, and police involvement. Fortunately, models
            exist for how to engage students, families, and educators in whole
            school approaches that center healing and help support all students,
            including those who have experienced trauma. Though each school or
            school district has unique needs, some models worth considering include

                New York cannot afford to be short-sighted by scaling back on existing
                school-based behavioral health resources; in fact, now is the time to
                invest more in the student supports so they can thrive social
                emotionally and academically.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            At the same time, New York must also strengthen schools’ access to
            clinical and community-based services. Though no longer providing all
            services on site, during the pandemic, many Article 31 School Based
            Mental Health clinics have found ways to identify and connect with
            students who have increased need. Community-based behavioral health
            providers are also critically important when schools have limited access
            to on-site mental health resources or staff. New Child and Family
            Treatment and Support Services (CFTSS) provide family-focused,
            community-based services designed to prevent the need for more intensive
            services later in life. These services can reach more children if they
            are integrated into education settings, and if they are made available
            to children outside of Medicaid, including children in the Child Health
            Plus program. Despite budget restrictions, New York cannot afford to be
            short-sighted by scaling back on existing school-based behavioral health
            resources; in fact, now is the time to invest more in the student
            supports so they can thrive social emotionally and academically.
